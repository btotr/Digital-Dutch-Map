Digital Dutch map using Stamen. Used to print on forex and highlight point of interests.

See: https://github.com/btotr/Digital-Dutch-Map/wiki/Project-details form additional details

#usage

node pdf.js 

this will create both a pdf and html file with the map.

#known issues

Currently javascript isn't executed when creating the pdf. A workaround is to open the html in a web browser and use the print facility to print to pdf. For high resolution printing i recommend a screen grabber.
